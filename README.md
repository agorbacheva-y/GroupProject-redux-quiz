# Redux Quiz

Technigo Week 8 Group Project Daniel Read, Michael Holm, Preeti Vadali, and Ayumi Gorbacheva-Yamamoto

The assignment was to create a multiple-choice quiz game using Redux.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started the project by building off of the boiler plate given. Quiz data (questions and multiple choices) were hard-coded but could be fetched from an API as a future sprint. 

Additional keys were added to global state in the reducer in order to implement the timer. This project allowed us to practice determining the usage of global state with Redux or local state with useState.
